        <h2>Instructions For Making The Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To begin making the Pumpkin Tawa Paratha Recipe, we will first pressure cook the pumpkin till it is completely cooked, this will take about 4 to 5 whistle and Once down allow the pressure to release by itself and mash them well.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl combine the flour, salt, mashed pumpkin, a tablespoon of oil and knead adding little water at a time to make firm and smooth dough. Add one tablespoon of oil to coat the dough and knead again. Cover and set aside for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions. Preheat the iron skillet on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Roll the paratha dough portions into balls and flatten them with the palm of your hand. Toss them on flour and roll them out into circles of approximately 3 inches in diameter. Put 1/4 teaspoon oil and spread it on the rolled dough.</li>
            <li>We need to get a triangle shape, to do so, first fold into a semi-circle, then fold the semi-circle into half again. You get a mini triangle shape. Tossing the triangle on a little flour, roll it out gently into a larger triangle. Continue the same process of rolling with the remaining dough portions.</li>
            <li>With skillet on medium high heat, place one rolled out dough on the skillet. After a few seconds you will notice an air pockets popping out. At this point flip the plain paratha and smear about 1/2 a teaspoon of ghee. Using a flat spatula do a light pressing and turning motion to cook to the pumpkin paratha.</li>
            <li>Flip to the other side and press and turn in a similar way. You will notice brown spots around the pumpkin parathas and it will be slightly crisp. Remove from heat and place on a platter or serve hot.</li>
            <li>Continue the similar process with the remaining rolled portions and stack the cooked pumpkin paratha one above the other and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
